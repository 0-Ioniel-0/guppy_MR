# guppy_MR
Repository for all scripts used to estimate guppy (Poecilia reticulata) mutation rate.

This repository contains scripts regarding:
1) reads trimming
2) reads alignment
3) bam files manipulation
4) variant calling
5) vcf intersection and missing parents removal
6) finding de novo variants
7) finding callable genomic sites
8) preparing variants for DNMF filter
9) hard filtering of candidates
10) heterozygosity in family
11) BAMSurgeon simulation (FNR)

Note that some scripts need to be edited to change your DP thresholds, individuals' positions in the VCF files, header length.
