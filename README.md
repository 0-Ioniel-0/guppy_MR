# guppy_MR
Repository for all scripts used to estimate guppy (Poecilia reticulata) mutation rate.

This repository contains scripts regarding:
1) reads trimming
2) reads alignment
3) bam files manipulation
4) variant calling
5) vcf intersection
6) finding de novo variants
7) finding callable genomic sites

Positions 6th and 7th are original Python scripts written by me.
